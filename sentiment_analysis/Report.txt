The model selection is one of the most critical step in ML.

Following steps involve in the current project:

1) Read and clean the data.
2) Tokenize and generate feature matrix.
3) prepare training and testing data.
4) implement different models to test and select the best performing model.
5) predict the sentiment of the texts in required file.

In CNN model, only 2 epochs have been performed due to heavy time consumption, where accuracy achieved on
training dataset is 0.57.

Similarly, accuracy for different models is listed below.

Accuracy for Random forest on data:  0.8782808398950132
Accuracy for Logis Regression on data:  0.9550524934383202
Accuracy for DT gini on data:  0.8989501312335958
Accuracy for DT entropy on data:  0.8996062992125984
Accuracy for SVM on data:  0.9665354330708661
Accuracy for MultinomialNB on data:  0.9448818897637795

As it can be observed that SVM has performed best on training dataset. The final script is based on SVM which 
can be found in support_vector folder. 

The result/final_output is in 'result.txt'.
